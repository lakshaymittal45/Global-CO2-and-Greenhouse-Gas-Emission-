# Global-CO2-and-Greenhouse-Gas-Emission

🌍Global CO₂ & Greenhouse Gas Emissions📊
I’m excited to share a Power BI dashboard I created to visualize and analyze global carbon emissions and energy consumption trends from the 1850s to 2023 — using a powerful open-source dataset that spans nearly every country worldwide.
This interactive dashboard helps explore the long-term environmental impact of industrialization, energy use, and population growth — offering insights for researchers, sustainability professionals, policymakers, and data enthusiasts alike.

🔍 Key Metrics & Features:
 ✅ CO₂ Emissions: Total, Per Capita, and Per GDP
 ✅ By Source: Coal, Oil, Gas, Cement, Land Use, Flaring
 ✅ Cumulative Emissions: CO₂ by type and totals
 ✅ CO₂ including Land Use Change (absolute and normalized)
 ✅ GHG Trends: Total, Per Capita, With/Without Land Use
 ✅ Methane & Nitrous Oxide CO₂ Equivalents
 ✅ Energy Data: Total Primary Energy, Per Capita, Per GDP
 ✅ Population & GDP Trends
 ✅ Trade CO₂ & Trade Share CO₂ (with averages)
 ✅ Average values across metrics for historical perspective

🛠️ Technical Approach:
🔄 Data Cleaning & Transformation using Power Query
📐 Custom DAX measures for advanced calculations and trend analysis
🎯 Interactive filtering with slicers (country, year, metric)
📊 Use of KPI cards, time-series graphs, and tooltips for storytelling
🧹 Addressed missing/null values with logical replacements & filters

🎯 Why This Matters:
Understanding these patterns is crucial in today’s climate crisis. This dashboard helps:
▪️ Researchers analyze emission trends over time.
▪️ Policymakers make data-backed decisions.
▪️ Students and educators explore climate data interactively.
▪️ Anyone passionate about sustainability see the full picture — historically and globally.

💡 Outcomes & Learnings:
▪️ Emissions per capita vary drastically — highlighting climate inequality.
▪️ Strong correlation between GDP growth & fossil fuel emissions.
▪️ Historical cumulative emissions reveal clear accountability patterns.
▪️ An invaluable tool for climate researchers, educators, and analysts.
▪️ Some countries show signs of decoupling emissions from growth, while others lag. 

Through this project, I gained valuable insights into how carbon emissions are deeply tied to population growth, energy dependency, and economic development — and how these patterns vary drastically across countries and over time and the impact of industrialization, and the shift in global energy use.
On a personal level, I significantly strengthened my skills in data cleaning, DAX, and Power BI storytelling, while deepening my understanding of climate data and its real-world impact. This project taught me how to build scalable dashboards, manage complex datasets, and effectively communicate environmental insights through data.
